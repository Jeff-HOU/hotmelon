# hotmelon
This is a hackathon project hosted on .tech domain using AWS -- Angelhack 2017 (http://angelhack.com)<br>
One of the most disturbing thing for a student may be how to make a fancy Slide for presentation. Our project aims at reducing the pain, transforming an academic paper into a wonderful slide automatically. <br>
It incorporates NLP to process the paper, an interactive voice-commanded chat box to style it, and leverage Slide API from google to generate slides. <br>
